HI, welcome to my Enote-System! This is my final project for quater 1 exam at TRinity International School. With this system, you can take notes, edit, and even create your own ones. To get started, first download all the requiremenrs.txt file. Don't forget to download django by typing command, pip install django. Then, open the project in Phycharm, go to the project folder by typing cd EnotesSystem in the terminal, and finally, run by typing the command, python manage.py runserver.
This is how the website should look like :
